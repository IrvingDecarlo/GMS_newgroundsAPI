# GMS_newgroundsAPI
Newgrounds.io API (Beta v3) integration for Game Maker Studio (1.4)

This repository contains the .gmez extension for GMS with the Newgrounds API Integration. 

For the integration to work, the user should also download the newgrounds.io file.
(link: https://bitbucket.org/newgrounds/newgrounds.io-for-javascript-html5)

To use the newgrounds.io file:
1. After downloading the newgrounds repository, locate the file "newgroundsio.js", which should be at (download directory)/ng.io/bin;
2. Add an extension to your GMS project;
3. Add a new file to the extension (by right-clicking on the extension within GMS, then clicking on "Add File");
4. Add the file newgroundsio.js to the extension.

After that, the GMS API Integration extension should work normally.

Instructions on each function are given within the ngAPIextension.js file, which is inside the .gmez extension.

Note that the integration is incomplete (as of August 17th). The only integrated elements are medals and scoreboards.
